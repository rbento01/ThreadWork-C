# ThreadWork-C
The task is to create 5 threads managing buffers: a buffer_circular with 10 elements receiving values from 40000 to 10001, and a buffer_final_crescente storing these values in ascending order after subtracting 10000. Two threads are producers adding values, and three are consumers processing and storing them in buffer_final_crescente.
